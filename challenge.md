About the challenge
Are you ready to push the boundaries of AI? Build the next generation of intelligent, autonomous applications. This isn't just a hackathon—it's your chance to unleash the power of Agentic AI and show the world what's possible. 

Your challenge is to create an Agentic Application—using the llama-3 1-nemotron-nano-8B-v1 large language reasoning mode, deployed as an NVIDIA NIM inference microservice, and at least one Retrieval Embedding NIM. 

Your project will be deployed on the scalable infrastructure of either an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) Cluster or an Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint. It's a full-stack AI project that will test your skills and leave you with a real-world application.

Why Participate?
This hackathon is more than just a competition, it's a launchpad for your skills and creativity.

Level Up Your Skills: Get hands-on experience with cutting-edge AI models and AWS services. This is your chance to build a real-world project that will supercharge your portfolio.
Connect with Experts: Network with fellow developers, learn from industry leaders, and get help from team experts at AWS and NVIDIA.
Win Big: Compete for recognition and premium prizes.
Get started: Access & Credits
We want to make it easy for you to focus on the fun part—building! Teams of enterprise professionals may request $100 USD in Promotional Credits to help you complete your project.

Here’s how to get them:

Make sure your team is registered for the hackathon.
Have a valid submission idea ready to go.
Complete this form. Credits will be distributed to each team.
*Note: The $100 promotional credit is a one-time voucher per team/project and is not cumulative or transferable. Once an individual has been part of a team that has received a credit, they are ineligible to receive another credit, even if they join a different team or start a new project.

We've set aside these credits to help you get started, but keep a couple of important things in mind:

The $100 promotional credits can cover approximately 24 hours of the two required NVIDIA NIM microservices running on either SageMaker or Amazon EKS. 
Your dashboard will show your remaining balance, and you will be responsible for the allocation of this budget to the overall AWS services you will need, i.e. NVIDIA NIM microservices running on either Amazon SageMaker AI or Amazon EKS, storage, networking, security services etc. Be sure to monitor your usage dashboard to avoid running out of credit before the hackathon ends.
Once all credits are exhausted, your access to the services will be cut off, and no further usage will be allowed, so keep an eye on your dashboard to monitor your remaining balance.
In the meantime, get to know the NVIDIA and AWS resources! Interact, and experiment with the NVIDIA NIM microservices hosted on build.nvidia.com. In addition, AWS offers AWS Free Tier, where you can gain hands-on experience with AWS products and services.
